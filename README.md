Hello dear readers

I would like to let you participate in my final project in Swift UI and as far as the project is concerned I have decided on a student app where young students can easily book their student trips from the university or from home after their studies and you can do the whole thing yourself freely according to their time and possibilities and we have also included the suitable foreign job offers so that the students have the opportunity to earn a few extra hours abroad.

I hope you enjoy reading and following. Of course I will keep you up to date and also show you all the built-in features
